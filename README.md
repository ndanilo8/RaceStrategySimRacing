# RaceStrategySimRacing
[Work in progress] A python written script/software that builds a race strategy specially designed for endurance simRacing. But can be adapted for real life racing as well as the concept is the same.

On the root of the repo you will find the first version that simply does the average of the laps the user inputs. 
On the folder Race_strategy_alpha you'll find the version I'm currently developing that, this time, uses a better foundation... databases to store data!

If you find this project interesting and have the core skills feel free to hit me up and join the collaborators team.
